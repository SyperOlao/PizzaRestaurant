The MVC (Model-View-Controller) folder structure typically consists of three main folders:

1. Models: This folder contains all the data models that represent the data and business logic of the application. These models are responsible for interacting with the database and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

2. Views: This folder contains all the user interface components such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. These files are responsible for rendering the data to the user and handling user interactions.

3. Controllers: This folder contains all the controller files that act as intermediaries between the models and views. The controllers receive requests from the user, retrieve data from the models, and pass that data to the views for rendering.

In addition to these three main folders, there may be other folders such as Config, Helpers, and Middleware that contain configuration files, helper functions, and middleware functions respectively. Overall, the MVC folder structure is designed to promote modularity and separation of concerns in web applications.
